## Overview

Basically, here are some typical Java and little bit of React tasks like: Proxy, JIT, Class loaders, Threads and etc. You can find details in certain folders. Down below I will just provide some basic information about lectures.

### Why?

Actually, I was dreaming about getting a job after completing all lectures, homework and graduation work, but.. They stopped employing new people after.. You know what.
